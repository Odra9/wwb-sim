# WWB Simulation
## What is WWB?
From what I can understand, WWB was a board game created for the sole purpose of being the worst possible board game possible, and sold for charity

## Why simulating?
The game is so bad to actually play that it's actually impossibile to finish. It requires a string of circa 204 consecutive 5s on a standard d6 die.
This is not the first instance of WWB sim btw, this is just my take, made as exercise.

#### How to use
Just compile and run the files
